  "MB.ForlornPhilosopherDescr": "You are a soul scalded by knowledge, cursed to wander the world as a prophet of futility, your every utterance a scripture of sorrow etched in the flesh of your own doubt.",
  "MB.PaleOneDescr": "You dwell at the edge of all things—watching, wordless, neither kin nor kindred—wracked by visions and violent fugues, yet mostly still, as if waiting for the end you were born to deserve.",
  "MB.SacrilegiousSongbirdDescr": "Your voice once mocked kings and now serves darker courts—a cursed melody gifted by godless things, your soul flays itself with every note, but the gold flows and the crowd always begs for more.",
  "MB.SheddingVicarDescr": "You peel away flesh like falsehood, preaching salvation through agony—each strip a sermon, each scab a scripture, and when the blood no longer clots, the truth shall be revealed beneath the ruin.",

  "MB.BetrayedPhantomDescr": "You are a hollow echo draped in stolen flesh, denied death yet unliving, your soul leashed by a nameless pact—what walks in your skin is not you, but it remembers enough to suffer.",

  "MB.FanaticPhysicianDescr": "You cut where others pray, stitch where others scream—hailed as genius or heretic, you don’t care; the body is your altar, and pain is just another variable.",
  "MB.FugitiveKnightDescr": "You wear a dead man’s honor like stolen skin, hidden in his cursed plate and parading as virtue—your knighthood is a lie, your legacy a crime, but so long as the armor holds, no truth can touch you.",
  "MB.GodlessSouldoctorDescr": "You shattered your skull to set your spirit free, threading sinew and voice into a glass-born head—mocked by gods, rebuilt by pain, you are surgeon and sermon, healed only through unholy desecration.",

  "MB.SinEaterDescr": "You gorge on the sins of the dying, cursed and holy in equal measure—abhorred by gods, sought by kings, damned so others may die clean.",
  "MB.SinfulSailorDescr": "You drank, brawled, and plundered with glee—now your sins live inside you, a parasite steering you toward damnation.",
  "MB.SlappingBastardDescr": "You can’t hold a blade, but your ruined hands hit like judgment—clumsy, brutal, and fueled by a lifetime too mean to kill you.",
  "MB.Soul-DamnedDrunkardDescr": "You drink to forget, fight to remember, and laugh like damnation's jester—your soul is lost, your liver begs for mercy, but the bottle never lets you down.",
  "MB.SvampätareDescr": "Once noble, now nothing but a laughing ruin—you found the red mushrooms, and they found you, and now you wander, chewing visions and muttering truths no one asked for.",
  "MB.THEBellfounderDescr": "You forged bells in silence until one sang the world’s true ending—now you carry its echo, reshaping fate with each toll, even as it reshapes you.",
  "MB.TheSharpCardDescr": "You dodged death in the mud for debt in the shadows—trained by a guild of secrets, bound by contract and coin, every move now costs more than blood.",
  "MB.TormentedToymakerDescr": "Grief splintered your mind and your craft—now your toys twitch with cursed life, spreading sorrow and slaughter with every wind-up and whir.",

  "MB.CavernousDwellerDescr": "As a goblin of soot and stone, you crawl through black tunnels with gem-fevered eyes, squinting at the sun through obsidian glass, hoarding metal like it’s holy and loving every filthy second.",
  "MB.GoblinGrifterDescr": "You’re a goblin grifter in ribbons and lies, crooning nonsense on a hurdy-gurdy while slipping truth from pockets and sense from skulls, drunk on mischief and your own tall tales.",
  "MB.HalfBreedDescr": "You are a half-goblin-half-human caught between boot and burrow, mistrusted by men, mocked by kin — never whole, never home, just a spark in the ashes pretending to be either torch or traitor.",
  "MB.MutantRunagateDescr": "You are a goblin gone wrong, a fugitive freak pumped full of green godhood—your body twisted, your purpose unclear, and somewhere out there, the mad thing that made you still calls you “mine.” ",
  "MB.NachtreuterDescr": "You’re a thrill-crazed goblin streaking through the dark on stolen hooves, leaping rooftops with wild eyes and wild laughter—speed is your gospel, danger your only friend.",
  "MB.OgreHumongobbDescr": "You’re an ogre-sized goblin mountain—half myth, half meat, all muscle—born in blood and bad omens, worshipped by your smaller kin as a stomping, burping, divine catastrophe.",
  "MB.RedCapDescr": "You’re a blood-slick goblin butcher, strutting through nightmares in flayed couture—your cap must drip red, your blades must sing, and only then do you feel properly dressed for murder.",
  "MB.ShonkyShulkerDescr": "You’re a goblin sneak with smoke in your veins, living off lies, larceny, and well-placed flames—no one sees you coming, and by the time they notice, their gold’s gone and something’s on fire.",
  "MB.SumpGoblinDescr": "You’re a slime-slick goblin bred in the SVMP, all gills, warts, and hunger—crawling through filth with bulbous eyes and a belly full of whatever didn’t bite back.",
  "MB.TheKwarkDescr": "You are the Kwark—a swarm of biting, shrieking goblins in rat-skins and vermin masks, moving as one hateful blur through cracks and cravices, overwhelming prey with giggles, gouges, and glorious chaos.",
  "MB.TribalGoblinDescr": "You are a tribal goblin of the SVMP—blackbomb builder, pipe-smoker, claw-hunter, kynegöbblin, bone-flinger, or caw-caw fool—born in bog-stink and pecking orders, loyal only to mud, madness, and your own.",

  "MB.GlitterbornScumDescr": "You are a glitterborn elf, ever-grinning and sugar-sweet, leaving trails of sparkle and song wherever you flit—because if you ever stopped smiling, the others might notice...",
  "MB.EsotericToymakerDescr": "You are an elf of perfect purpose, joyfully turning gears and screwing bolts on your one sacred stool—smiling all the while, for questioning the order would be terribly inappropriate, wouldn’t it?",
  "MB.HereticalGnomeDescr": "You’re a cheerful little gnome (not an elf, but close enough!), happily tending the merry woods—even as your cousins sprout leaves and gurgle sap, isn’t nature just full of surprises?",
  "MB.OccultGiftwrapperDescr": "You are a Giftwrapper elf, trained in the sacred folds and festive chants, joyfully binding chaos in ribbons and tags—because if the corners aren’t perfect, who knows what might slip through?",
  "MB.ToothyDesserterDescr": "A jolly little elf with a tray full of sweets and a smile just a bit too wide, you bake with love, laughter, and ingredients no one dares ask about.", 
  "MB.WretchedSleigherDescr": "A squinty-eyed elf with hay in your boots and silence in your bones, you tend beasts with quiet love—because something has to keep the sleigh warm, even when the stars go out."
